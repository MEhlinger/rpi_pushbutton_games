#### Pygame Interactive Display

## What
This repository contains the code, in Python 2 with pygame,
for one (or more) small games intended to be run on a raspberry
pi, in a public location, with nontraditional input methods.

The idea is to place a pi in the the university's  computer science 
building, in a glass case, and attach input devices to the exterior
of the case. The games should be small, brief, and memorable,
the kind of thing a game or non-gamer alike might be able to casually
play around with for a couple minutes between classes.
